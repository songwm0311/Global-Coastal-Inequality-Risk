# Global-Coastal-Inequality-Risk
Global Coastal Inequality Risk quantifies how socioeconomic and infrastructure inequalities amplify flood risk in global coastal communities. The code integrates flood exposure, population, and accessibility data to construct a composite risk index and identify high-exposure, low-resilience areas across regions.
